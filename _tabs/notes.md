You can find any notes here.

These are notes I compiled during my undergraduate and graduate studies, along with additional material from my independent learning. I’ve aimed to keep them detailed and clear, though some inaccuracies may remain and are being continuously revised. They primarily serve as a personal archive and reference, but I’d be glad to discuss any part that interests you.
